      <p>
        Hi, I am a software developer with a passion for problem solving. My interests are within web application development, 
        distributed systems, interaction design, interactive art, and machine learning. I studied at West Virginia University 
        where I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science. I currently live in Pittsburgh and employed by 
        <a href="https://wahilacreative.com" target="_blank">Wahila Creative</a>, where I am lucky enough to work with a wonderful group of folks to 
        solve lots of super interesting development and UI/UX problems.

      <p>A couple of cats named Ada and Eugene have been nice enough to accompany me on my adventures (and let's be honest,
        they do most of the work :) ).</p>
